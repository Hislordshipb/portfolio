<h2>My top 3 animation Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Elemental (2023)</h3>
<p>While very simplistic and predictable at all points, it is rather "cute".</p>

<p>It handles its emotional core very well, with the characterizations and voice-acting being the best part (as well as the excellent vibrant worldbuilding).. but the content is so sparse it makes the pacing feel sluggish and the film a tad long. As a romance, it's okay and delivers on its premise! The other layers, like the "looming threat", are a second-thought and a mark that needed to be checked.</p>
    
<p>As a Pixar movie and after 7 years of development? I'm not sure.. I guess I expected more from the narrative. Had this been done by a smaller and newer studio, I can imagine only praises. Maybe just say the smaller division did it!</p>
    
<p>Sadly, this is a perfect movie for streaming.</p>

<h3>2. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)</h3>

<p>I was expecting anything, and as a kid that grew up with the 1987's cartoon, it gave me nothing. Truthfully, it wasn't made to appeal to me (I'm not buying or playing with toys anymore).. but I still think most of these changes to be a downgrade affecting the general world building, a few of the main characters (O'Neil, Baxter and Splinter), and even some minor villains' standing. But as a release made only to capitalize on merchandise for children, it doesn't have to be anything more than what it is. I can see kids having fun and coming out wanting to kick things.

<p>As a film, it has awkward sound mixing and a soundtrack that assists with the griminess of the world. But it is visually quite interesting and the action is energetic, with a "scribbles" style that is very different! And while I appreciate the casting of actual teenagers, I'm not sure about the improvised-feeling dialogue. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable (your Adam Sandler-like crew that do their job and pad the IMDB with "talent"). The writing is also terribly familiar, predictable and somewhat dull. It isn't particularly good, even if modern.</p>
    
<p>I still don't like seth rogen putting his grease hands on as many properties as he is financially capable off, since he is clearly not a good writer, actor or franchise builder. But if it's good enough for kids.. then by all means, make more (which is certainly better than nothing at all).</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>

<p>I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in "Across the Spider-Verse." The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.

<p>The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists. The humor throughout the film is spot-on, providing moments of levity without undermining the emotional depth of the narrative.</p>

<p>Just go and see it.</p>
